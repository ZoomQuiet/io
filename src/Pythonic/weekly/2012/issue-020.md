# Hi Pythonistas. 

We got t-shirts. We are really excited to do this for the community and hope everyone picks one up.  Those of you who follow us on twitter saw us tweet the various mocks while we were designing. They are a high quality blend shirt, same one Github uses for their shirts. 

So if you are so inclined, support Pycoders Weekly and get a shirt!

We are on the look out for new sponsors. Postmates our first sponsor has allowed us to do awesome things like get stickers, and keeping the mailchimp from breaking our legs. If you ( or your company) are interested in sponsoring Pycoder's Weekly simply reply to this email and let us know.

The new hawtness from 
[Randall Degges](https://twitter.com/rdegges)

- [Jarvis - Python coding companion](http://madlag.github.com/jarvis/) (github.com)

Jarvis was inspired by works of 
[Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)
, especially his talk 
[Inventing on Principle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII)
. The idea is similar to the principles around LightTable. They describe it as a companion for Python programmer to get the answers they need. A little something to hold you over until LightTable is finished with Python support.

HTTPie is a CLI, cURL-like tool for humans.

Andrea O. K. Wright contacted us about the talk she gave at Pycon US because she thought this may be of interest to Pycoders. She was right, this is pretty awesome. This is a talk about language interop between Python and Scala with a walk through the lower-level code that allows inter-language communication to happen. Link is talk materials, video 
[here](http://pyvideo.org/video/681/polyglot-programming-with-python-pythonscala-in).
