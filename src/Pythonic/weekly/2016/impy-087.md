`Kyōkai (境界)` 嗯哼,因为日语有完全可发音的罗马形式,所以,总是被选为工程名嘛?!

也使用了 Blueprintslink 进行扩展,基本上就是 flask 的异步简化版本.

- [访问控制: 一个 Django 许可的应用比较](http://www.vinta.com.br/blog/2016/controlling-access-a-django-permission-apps-comparison/)
    + django

There are many ways to handle permissions in a project. For instance we may have model level permissions, object level permissions, fine grained user permission or role based. Either way we don't need to be writing any of those from scratch, Django ecosystem has a vast amount of permission handling apps that will help us with the task. In this post we will compare how some popular permission apps work so you know which one suits your project needs.


- [Machinalis: 搜索外星人](http://www.machinalis.com/blog/searching-for-aliens/)
    + image processing

Do you know what they are? If you are thinking of irrigation circles, you are wrong. Do not believe the lies of the conspirators. Those are, undoubtedly, proofs of extraterrestrial visitors on earth. As I want to be ready for the first contact I need to know where these guys are working. It should be easy with so many satellite images at hand. So I asked the machine learning experts around here to lend me a hand. Surprisingly, they refused. Mumbling I don’t know what about irrigation circles. Very suspicious. But something else they mentioned is that a better initial approach would be to use some computer-vision detection technique. Note - Code is here https://github.com/machinalis/satimg/blob/master/Searching%20for%20aliens.ipynb

- [为何要学习 Python ?](https://iluxonchik.github.io/why-you-should-learn-python/)
    + community

Hopefully this post gave you some insight into why you should consider giving Python a go. This post is coming from someone who feels “guilty” for talking not so good about Python in the past and is now all over the hype train. In my defense, it was just a “personal preference thing”, when people asked me about which language they should learn first, for instance, I usually suggested Python.
