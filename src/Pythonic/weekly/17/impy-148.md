- [如何对机器学习代码进行单元测试](https://medium.com/@keeper6928/how-to-unit-test-machine-learning-code-57cf6fd81765)
    + testing, machine learning

Over the past year, I’ve spent most of my working time doing deep learning research and internships. And a lot of that year was making very big mistakes that helped me learn a lot about not just about ML, but about how to engineer these systems correctly and soundly. One of the main principles I learned during my time at Google Brain was that unit tests can make or break your algorithm and can save you weeks of debugging and training time.

对 AI 的单元测试也必须是 AI 了?

    + tree, data structure

This post is an attempt to we better understand the Tree Data Structure and clarify any doubts about it. We will learn about what is a tree, examples of it, its terminology, how it works, and a technical implementation (a.k.a code!)

- [超越 Python 惯用法](https://medium.com/@okaleniuk/going-beyond-the-idiomatic-python-a321b6c6a5e6)
    + idiomatic

Note - If you have read Writing Idiomatic Python - By Jeff Knupp. You might want to read what Oleksandr has to say in this post. Personally I learned a lot from the book and recommend it regularly to everyone. People don’t speak entirely in idioms unless they are totally off their rockers. Overusing idioms makes you seem more than self-confident, full of air, and frankly not playing with a full deck. It is fair to middling to spice your language with idioms a little bit, but build the whole speech entirely out of them is beside the point.

- [TensorFlow 101](https://mubaris.com/2017-10-21/tensorflow-101)
    + tensorflow

TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library developed at Google. TensorFlow uses data flow graphs for numerical computations. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. In this post we will learn very basics of TensorFlow and we will build a Logistic Regression model using TensorFlow.

所以,  PyTorch 在爆发...

    + Bayesian

Welcome to "Bayesian Modelling in Python" - a tutorial for those interested in learning how to apply bayesian modelling techniques in python (PYMC3). This tutorial doesn't aim to be a bayesian statistics tutorial - but rather a programming cookbook for those who understand the fundamental of bayesian statistics and want to learn how to build bayesian models using python. The tutorial sections and topics can be seen below.



- [在 Clojure, R, 以及 Python 用 GraalVM 进行混合嵌入开发](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2017/10/22/embedded-interop-between-clojure-r-and-python-with-graalvm/)
    + Clojure

In my talk at Clojure Conj I mentioned how a project from Oracle Labs named GraalVM might have to potential for Clojure to interop with Python on the same VM. At the time of the talk, I had just learned about it so I didn’t have time to take a look at it. Over the last week, I’ve managed to take it for a test drive and I wanted to share what I found.

(`是也乎:`

所以? Clojure 在拼命包容其它语言来给自己续命?

    + sublime, offtopic

Through my career as a software developer, I have appreciated one text editor the most, Sublime Text. I began with writing code in Notepad++ long long time ago, then tried IDEs as well but nothing came as close to working smoothly as Sublime Text. This blog is also written using Sublime Text.

    + fsm

I was once a huge fan of FSMs (Finite State Machines) as a mechanism to keep track of states. Automata theory is the basis of class of computational problems solvable by discrete math. I had used fysom in the past but this time I wanted something home grown. I was able to write complex language parse in a couple hours using only 200 lines of code.
