- [包的各种层次](http://sedimental.org/the_packaging_gradient.html)
    + packaging

Packaging in Python has a bit of a reputation for being a bumpy ride. This is mostly a confused side effect of Python's versatility. Once you understand the natural boundaries between each packaging solution, you begin to realize that the varied landscape is a small price Python programmers pay for using the most balanced, flexible language available.

    + TDD

In this series of posts I want to try an experiment. I want to guide you through the creation of a simple interpreter in Python using a pure TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach. The posts will be structured like a game, where every level is represented by a new test that I will add to the suite.

- [Principle Component Analysis in Python](http://benalexkeen.com/principle-component-analysis-in-python/)
    + machine learning

Principle component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised statistical technique that is used for dimensionality reduction. It turns possible correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated ones called ‘Principle Components’. In this post we’ll be doing PCA on the pokemon data set.

- [用 Python 和 GooPyCharts 构建图表](https://datascienceplus.com/creating-graphs-with-python-and-goopycharts/)
    + charting, google charts

Last summer, I came across an interesting plotting library called GooPyCharts which is a Python wrapper for the Google Charts API. In this article, we will spend a few minutes learning how to use this interesting package. GooPyCharts follows syntax that is similar to MATLAB and is actually meant to be an alternative to matplotlib.

- [用 Python 中的长时间内存网络进行多步时间序列预测](http://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-step-time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-networks-python/)
    + deep learning

The Long Short-Term Memory network or LSTM is a recurrent neural network that can learn and forecast long sequences.
