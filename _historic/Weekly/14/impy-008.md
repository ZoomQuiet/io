- [Scraping cheap airline tickets](http://blog.redturtle.it/2014/11/12/scrapy/) »

It all started with a bet long time ago. One of my friends couldn't believe that it is actually possible nowadays to travel around the world with low-cost airlines.I think I won. With some python help and many hours of coding I was able to find all the necessary tickets and stay below the price criterion.

- [Using Pandas To Create an Excel Diff](http://pbpython.com/excel-diff-pandas.html) »

I am going to walk through a real world example of how to use pandas to automate a process that could be very difficult to do in Excel. My business problem is that I have two Excel files that are structured similarly but have different data and I would like to easily understand what has changed between the two files. Basically, I want an Excel diff tool.

- [Data Science with Hadoop - predicting airline delays.](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ofermend/IPython-notebooks/blob/master/blog-part-1.ipynb) »

Every year approximately 20% of airline flights are delayed or cancelled, resulting in significant costs to both travellers and airlines. As our example use-case, we will build a supervised learning model that predicts airline delay from historial flight data and weather information.

- [Supervised Learning: Support Vector Machines](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fonnesbeck/Bios366/blob/master/notebooks/Section6_4-Support-Vector-Machines.ipynb)  »

The support vector machine (SVM) is a classification method that attempts to find a hyperplane that separates classes of observations in feature space. In contrast to some other classifications methods we have seen (e.g. Bayesian), the SVM does not invoke a probability model for classification; instead, we aim for the direct caclulation of a separating hyperplane.
