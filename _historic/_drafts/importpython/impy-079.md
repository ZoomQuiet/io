    + django

One of the cornerstones of Django is that there’s a solid core that others can extend and share their extensions. So it’s good to celebrate the best of those. Here’s my list derived from this query on Github for projects started this year. Not sure about top but useful projects that one can use in personal or work projects/products. Have a look.

- [Django 生产力增压](https://medium.com/eshares-engineering/supercharging-django-productivity-at-eshares-8dbf9042825e#.hgd932ie5)
    + django

These design patterns also solidified a mentality within our team that there is an internal standard of handling models and views. We can extend our base classes to tackle any business requirement. Our codebase is constantly evolving, both in new features and how we model the world. Django has proven to be a valuable tool that lets us aim big and iterate often. Some might call this an anti-pattern nevertheless a novel approach.

- [Djangorecipe: 简单的测试覆盖率报告](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2016/06/30/djangorecipe-test-coverage.html)
    + django

Code coverage reports help you see which parts of your code are still untested. Yes, it doesn’t say anything about the quality of your tests, but at the least it tells you which parts of your code have absolute the worst kind of tests: those that are absent :-)


- [你的 Django 故事: 遇见 Anna Makarudze](http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/146535801439)

- [anymail/django-anymail: Django的邮件后端以及 webhooks 接入 Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid, SparkPost 等等](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail)
    + django

Anymail integrates several transactional email service providers (ESPs) into Django, with a consistent API that lets you use ESP-added features without locking your code to a particular ESP. It currently fully supports Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid, and SparkPost, and has limited support for Mandrill.

- [用 Python 探索 NFL Draft](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nfl-draft.html)
    + sport analysis

After reading a couple of posts by Michael Lopez about the NFL draft, I decided to recreate some of his analysis using Python (instead of R). Post being - https://statsbylopez.com/2016/05/02/the-nfl-draft-where-we-stand-in-2016/

- [文本分析，马尔可夫链和圣经引用生成器.](https://blog.rinatussenov.com/text-analysis-markov-chains-and-bible-quotes-generator-fd0fa09ced20#.n4au9mwdi)
    + machine learning

Text analysis and patterns are very interesting topics for me. I think every author has their own unique, distinctive pattern. The way they build sentences and phrases, not only in terms of tone, but the subconscious choices of word pairings and sequences. How their sentences begin and end, and what they put in the middle; they leave their cerebral fingerprints on paper, blog posts or even FaceBook status updates. I think it is a very achievable, having enough base data, to identify the author Note - It's a trivial example but a good starting point for someone looking to learn/explore Markov chains.
