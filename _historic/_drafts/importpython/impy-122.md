- [PyCon JP 2017 议题开始征集](https://pycon.jp/2017/en/talks/cfp/)
    + pycon

Our team is looking for a wide range of each topic which you would like to talk. The same as in the past, we are planing to have talk session(30minute), poster session(booth style), Lighting talks(5minute) and more. Even if you are a python beginner, please do not hesitate to apply for it.



- [用 Python Flask NASA API 以及 Twilio MMS 和火星机器人聊天](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/texting-robots-on-mars-using-python-flask-nasa-apis-and-twilio-mms.html)
    + flask, nasa

NASA has a bunch of awesome APIs which give you programmatic access to the wonders of space. I think the Mars Rover Photos API in particular is really amazing as you can use it to see what kind of pictures the Mars Curiosity rover has been taking. Let’s build an app using the Mars Rover API with Twilio MMS, Python and Flask to make it so that we can text a phone number and receive pictures from Mars.

- [用 OpenCV, Python, 和 dlib 进行 blink 检测](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/24/eye-blink-detection-opencv-python-dlib/)
    + opencv

In last week’s blog post, I demonstrated how to perform facial landmark detection in real-time in video streams.Today, we are going to build upon this knowledge and develop a computer vision application that is capable of detecting and counting blinks in video streams using facial landmarks and OpenCV.


- [Two Scoops of Django: Django 1.11 最佳实践已经发布](https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11)
    + python

The latest Edition focuses on Two Scoops of Django is out. I recall buying the first edition which was based on 1.5. This book holds a special place in the Django community IMHO. This Edition is focused on Django 1.11 and Python 3, with an appendix for working with Python 2.7. Revised material on nearly every topic within the book. 20+ pages of new material on Django REST Framework, security, forms, models, and more. I look forward to doing a review of the book as soon as it launches in Dead Tree Format in my country ( India ) like the previous editions.

This talk gives an overview of the Neo4j graph database and the Cypher query language from the point of view of a Python user. We'll look at how to run queries and visualise or extract those results into software such as Pandas. We'll also explore the property graph data model and look at how it differs from other data models.

- [如何限制 asyncio 内存使用?](https://quentin.pradet.me/blog/how-do-you-limit-memory-usage-with-asyncio.html)
    + asyncio

One of the first hurdles that you can encounter when trying out asyncio is "asyncio eats all my memory!". Indeed, to keep you CPU busy, you're encouraged to launch a lot of coroutines simultaneously. coroutines don't use a lot of memory by themselves, but what you're doing inside them can use quite a lot of memory.
