## 项目

- [RedisLive](https://github.com/kumarnitin/RedisLive) (github.com)

This is really awesome. If you manage any 
[Redis](http://redis.org/)
 servers this looks like it could be a must have. RedisLive is a beautiful monitoring tool for your Redis instances built on top of 
[Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) and 
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)


- [Teena](https://github.com/zacharyvoase/teena) (github.com)
From the readme "Teena aims to be a collection of ports of UNIX and Linux syscalls to pure Python, with an emphasis on performance and correctness.". Teena allows you to call systems calls directly from your python code. Currently implemented are tee and splice calls with more to come soon.

- [pyburrow](http://mobilewebup.com/software/pyburrow/) (mobilewebup.com)

pyburrow is a Python 3 library for crawling websites: capturing, archiving and processing their resources. The special thing about pyburrow is its low level nature by storing response body as unencoded bytes as well as response codes. Check it out.

- [Flask Ahoy - Here be Flask Modules!](http://flask-ahoy.com/)  (flask-ahoy.com)

This cool little site tracks the most popular Flask modules based on pypi downloads and user ratings. Definitely worth a look for you flaskers out there.

- [Dom](https://github.com/zachwill/dom) (github.com)

This is pretty incredible. easy command line application for checking domain availability. I know I do this couple times of month. 
Nice work [Zach.](https://twitter.com/zachwill).

- [Never fix a bug twice](http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/never-fix-a-bug-twice/) (lukeplant.me.uk)

This article is an interesting one. It advocates keeping an eye out for themes of issues and eliminate the possibility of the issue rather than testing for the latest symptom.

- [Python for rapid prototyping and computer vision research](http://www.kitware.com/cvpr2012.html) (kitware.com)

A lot of people doing computer vision research end up spending a lot of time in 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
. Now there is nothing wrong with 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
, but the contents of this tutorial provides a way to directly map common 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
syntax to Python to produce useful results. If you are interested in computer vision and are looking to use a bit more Python in your day to day, check this out!


- [Python debugging techniques](http://aymanh.com/python-debugging-techniques) (aymanh.com)

This article is a pretty great intro to debugging techniques for Python. If you are a new Python developer or are looking for a quick refresh of how to use pdb or Python logging to debug your code, this is the article for you.

- [Python Packaging: Hate, hate, hate everywhere](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere/) (pocoo.org)

Somewhat related to the news that new packaging won't make it into Python 3.3, 
[Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/)
talks about the history and current state of python packaging. There are plenty of good points here, definitely worth reading.
